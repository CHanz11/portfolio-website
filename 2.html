            <h3>Reaction</h3>
            <p>In this documentary it focuses A.I. technology to innovate in health care, as a computer engineering student it motivates to know more about this A.I. technology.  Behind from all the negative feedback from the society today that A.I. will have negative impact to human, there is still a positive side of A.I.  
            </p>
            <p>The two main subject of this documentary video are the A.I. as a speech recognition model and A.I. machine as a cure for blindness. I was so festinated that engineers and professionals today have reach this level where they develop an Artificial Intelligence machine to help curing deceases and helping person with disability to fulfill their needs. 
            </p>
            <p>The Artificial Intelligence for speech recognition really helps Tim that as an ALS decease to easily communicate to the person around him using the speech recognition. Communication is very helpful thing to use to understand each other, and creating a technology like google to simply transcribe words from a person with disability to talk is a big help to our society. 
            </p>
            <p>Deep mind sound imitation also helps Tim turned back his real voice from being unable to speak clearly. This Artificial Intelligence is powerful if combined with the speech recognition model. As a Computer Engineering student, I can suggest that combining these two technologies can be more innovating and accurate. If a person with ALS can use device like this that automatically turn his or voice from being unclear and transform this to his or her original voice, then communicating is way easier to that person. By creating a device like this, a person with disability like ALS will forgot that they have been diagnose in such decease.  This also be helpful and to their daily lives even if their bodies don't have any strength but having this device that can make you speak is so much powerful.
            </p>
            <p>The second technology that was introduced in this video is an A.I. to treat and prevent blindness from people that has an eyesight problem. Using image recognition an Artificial Intelligence was made from comparing samples that was taken and identifying the damage in the eye of the patient for me it is a time saver, because this device doesn't need a personal doctor to scan a patient's eye all you need to do is to take an image of the eye and send it to the server online and it will automatically send a result immediately after the scan. This Artificial Intelligence machine can prevent early blindness of the patient because it detects damages to the eye of the patient and find a cure for it immediately.
            </p>
            <p>As a student all I can suggest Innovation for this artificial intelligence machine is to create a low-cost model of this device and can be caried Anyware to help people in urban areas that is limited of knowledge and lack of money to the city and have an eye checkup. Using the device can save a thousand of money and also save a thousand if eye of the persons that wanted to see the colorful world.</p>
