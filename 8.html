            <h3>Reaction</h3>
            <p>
                In this video it shows how incredible an A.I. was it also states what are the capabilities of the Artificial Intelligence made by human today, how far can it go. It shows how they made A.I. like the baby A.I. it was created and has a capabilities of a baby human, how a baby interacts with the environment. This baby A.I. can learn like a baby and has a capability to learn like a human being it can also speak and can analyze and identify new encountered thing. Aside from the baby A.I. new technology today can also create   virtual A.I. and will made a copy of you virtually, by using cameras and recording your voice they can create you in a virtual world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Their are many A.I. innovation stated in the video for me as a computer engineering student this innovation can be farther be innovated. If I was the creator of the the baby A.I. instead they made it virtually they can create a prototype of a robotic baby so they can be interact with the baby physically. Using this way they can measure how can a baby A.I. deal things, learn and how will it react in the environment, succeeding this process will made them a next step of making a perfect human A.I.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the Artificial hands A.I. I was very amaze they can create a technology that can help imputated persons filling their missing parts of body using A.I. technology. For me to innovate it more farther they can use the impulse of the brain to control it instead of using your arm muscle, using this you can make and accurate control of the hands. This is very easy to use because  you just easily think about how you want to move a hand and it will be easily controlled. Lastly my suggestion for the 3d model AI of the person is to apply the real personality of the human that was copied to virtual, copy all his attitude and how would he/she interacts with people for the best result is to add a timeline memories of the human to the virtual A.I. si that even if the real human wil die the virtual copied A.I. of it self will remain in this world so that his/her relative can talk to the A.I. whenever they miss that person. 
            </p>
 
            <p>
                For me we are near to creating an A.I. that has a capability of thinking and acting as a real human, a A.I. like that need to be more improve and and intelligent and can change the world in the future. The more the A.I. is intelligent the more process it will undergo creating a perfect A.I. need something a computer that is capable of making faster task performance as an computer engineering as we enter to the new worl of technology I suggest that using a Quantum Computer is the best solution to create a human like A.I.. A quantum computer is a million times faster than a normal computer today it can perform task and solve millions of solution in just an few seconds unlike normal computer that was powered by a processor with a specific bits. For me A.I. made using a quantum technology is the only way to achieve what we are looking for a perfect A.I. that thinks like a brain of a human or even more faster than a human intelligence.
